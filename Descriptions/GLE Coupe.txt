The dynamic presence of a GLE Coupé is particularly true of the AMG model: with a sharpened coupé design all round, an independent front apron with AMG-specific radiator grille and wheels measuring up to 55.9 cm (22 inches). Another AMG-specific feature is the logo projector, which projects the AMG emblem onto the floor when the front doors are opened and with which the GLE 63 S 4MATIC+ Coupé is equipped as standard. The new headlamps ensure that the driver can see in the dark and the tail lamps ensure that the Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupé can be seen.
